## Building the App
To build the app you should use Android Studio as it requires Gradle.

To select the appropriate build variant in Android Studio, use the Build Variants tab or use the appropriate Gradle build command.

## Disclaimer

This mod was not intended to replace Sketchware Pro or Sketchware as it was intended to help those looking to develop games using the block programming language provided by Scratch!

I love Sketchware Pro and what the modding team has done to it, mind you there are many aspects like what I've done here that were not available or easily available so I re modded Sketchware Pro to be a standalone libGDX enabled application!  This means that you can install the application without interfering with Sketchware Pro projects or files :D!
